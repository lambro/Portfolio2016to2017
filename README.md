# Portfolio2016to2017

## New Year New Portfolio

This portfolio iteration is inspired by manga / comic style
I am making it easier to get to information, improving the user journey, and making it smoother with more transitions.

The last iteration was based in black and white so this time around I wanted to add more color.

This page is built with mobile first in mind.
